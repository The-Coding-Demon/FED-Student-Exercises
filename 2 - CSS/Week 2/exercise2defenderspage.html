        <h3>Oleksandr Zinchenko</h3>
        <p>A childhood Arsenal supporter, Oleksandr joined from Manchester City in July, reuniting with Mikel Arteta,
          who had coached him at City.

          The Ukraine international won four Premier League titles with his former club, as well as four League Cups,
          one FA Cup and played the full 90 minutes of the 2021 Champions League final.

          Comfortable playing at left back or in midfield, Alex - as he is known by team-mates - became the youngest
          ever goalscorer for the Ukraine national team when he netted against Romania in May 2016, aged 19. He was
          named Ukraine Footballer of the Year in 2019 and went on to become his country's youngest captain, taking the
          arm band aged 24, against France in March 2021.

        <h3 class='oddh3'>Takehiro Tomiyasu</h3>
        <p>
          Versatile defender Takehiro became our final signing of the summer when he joined the club from Serie A side
          Bologna on transfer deadline day.

          The powerful Japanese right back, who can also play at centre back, began his career with Avispa Fukuoka in
          his home country before moving to Europe in January 2018. He spent 18 months at Belgian club Sint-Truiden,
          where he was voted the club's Player of the Season for the 2018/19 campaign, before his performances earned
          him a move to Italy in July 2019.

          Takehiro then became a regular in Bologna's defence, making 63 appearances in his two seasons there.

          Known as Tomi, he is noted for his composure and technical ability, and is a regular Japan international,
          featuring at the 2020 summer Olympics in his home country.

        <h3>Kieran Tierney</h3>
        <p>Already a firm fans favourite, Kieran has underlined his status as one of the best young defenders on the
          continent during his first two years at the club.

          Signing from boyhood club Celtic - where he won four Scottish Premier League titles, two Scottish FA Cups and
          two Scottish League Cups all before the age of 22 - Kieran soon settled into life in London.

          He won the FA Cup in his debut season, impressing with his whole-hearted, fully committed style at left back,
          and he impressed again last season.

          A solid defender who also likes to get forward, he scored vital goals against West Brom and Benfica last term,
          and was a key part of the Scotland squad at Euro 2020 in the summer.

        <h3 class='oddh3'>Ben White</h3>
        <p>
          A big-money signing in the summer, central defender Ben has gone from strength to strength in recent seasons.

          Joining the Brighton & Hove Albion academy aged 16, he made his senior debut in August 2016, aged 18, before
          spending a season on loan to Newport County in League Two in 2017/18. The second half of the following
          campaign was spent on loan to Peterborough United in League One before another successful temporary switch
          followed - playing every game as he helped Leeds United win the 2019/20 Championship title, winning their
          Young Player of the Season Award in the process and also being named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year.

          He returned to Brighton last season, winning their Player of the Year award, and capped the season by making
          his England debut against Austria on June 2, 2021. He was later named in the Euro 2020 squad, though did not
          feature. A ball-playing centre back with great distribution, he can also play as a defensive midfielder or at
          right back.

        <h3>Gabriel Magalh√£es</h3>
        <p>Gabriel slotted seamlessly into the Gunners defence during his first season in London, impressing with his
          combativeness and composure in the back line, and contributing some important goals too.

          In fact he netted on his debut, away to Fulham on the opening day of the season, and was named Arsenal.com
          Player of the Month for September, October and November - reward for an explosive start to his career.

          The Brazil youth international is a cultured, imposing left-footed defender who is also comfortable playing
          the ball out from the back. Before joining Arsenal from Lille, Gabriel (full name Gabriel dos Santos
          Magalhaes) had started his career with Avai in Santa Catarina, Brazil.

          He played for his country at the 2017 South American U-20 Championships, and was part of the Under-23 squad at
          the summer Olympics in Tokyo.

        <h3 class='oddh3'>William Saliba</h3>
        <p>
          Promising young defender William spent the second half of last season back on loan in France, where he
          impressed for Nice, and is back in Ligue 1 this term, at Marseille.

          The imposing right-footed centre back made 20 league appearances for Nice, winning their Player of the Month
          award in January 2021.

          He started the last campaign as an unused sub for the Community Shield win over Liverpool, but had not made
          his Gunners debut by the time this season started.

          The France youth international has played all his football in his home country, having joined from
          Saint-Etienne in 2019.

        <h3>Jakub Kiwior</h3>
        <p>Jakub spent his youth career at Polish club GKS Tychy and then in Belgium with Anderlecht before moving to
          Slovakian side FK Zeleziarne Podbrezova as an 18-year-old.

          After spending a season there, Jakub moved to MSK Zilina where he made 46 appearances. During his two seasons
          with the Slovakian club, he helped them to a runners-up finish in the league in his first campaign, and the
          Slovakian Cup final the following year.

          His strong performances resulted in a move to Spezia in August 2021, where he became a regular in the starting
          line-up. Impressive displays in Serie A led to a first international call-up in June 2022, when Jakub made his
          full international debut during a Nations League draw against the Netherlands.

          In Qatar, he would play every minute of Poland's campaign, which brought clean sheets in their opening two
          matches against Mexico and Saudi Arabia as he helped his nation reach the last 16 for the first time in 36
          years.

        <h3 class='oddh3'>Rob Holding</h3>
        <p>
          One of our more experienced defenders, Rob passed the 100-appearance milestone last season and also captained
          the side on several occasions.

          Now into his sixth season at the club, the centre back has developed considerably since joining the club from
          Bolton Wanderers in 2016, where he had just been voted Player of the Season in the Championship.

          He ended his first season in London with convincing displays in both the FA Cup semi-final and final to earn
          his first silverware, and repeated the feat in 2020 with another victory over Chelsea at Wembley. He started
          last season lifting more silverware - the Community Shield - and in January 2021 he signed a new long-term
          contract with the club.

          A physically commanding but technically adept defender, Rob has represented England Under-21s, winning the
          Toulon Tournament in 2016.
