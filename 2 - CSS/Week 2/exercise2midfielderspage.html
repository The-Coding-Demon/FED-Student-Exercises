        <h3>Martin Odegaard</h3>
        <p>Having enjoyed a highly-productive loan spell with us in the second half of last season, Martin made his
          switch from Real Madrid permanent in the summer.

          A highly creative, technical attacking midfielder, Martin is most comfortable in the No. 10 role but can also
          play in deeper central midfield or out wide. Something of a child prodigy, the Norway international made his
          senior debut for Stromgodset aged 15, then signed for Madrid shortly afterwards and became their youngest-ever
          player, making his debut aged 16 years and 157 days.

          He enjoyed three successful loan spells in Holland and Spain before playing for the Gunners last season, and
          scoring in the north London derby victory at the Emirates in March. He has been a full international since
          August 2014, when he became his country's youngest-ever player, aged 15 years and 253 days.

        <h3 class='oddh3'>Thomas Partey</h3>
        <p>
          A powerful, skilful central midfielder, Thomas gave a number of stand-out performances during his debut
          season.

          Soon after arriving from Atletico Madrid just before the transfer deadline, the Ghanaian was making his mark
          in the Premier League - being named Man of the Match in the 1-0 win at Old Trafford.

          A combative ball-winner with the ability to dominate games, Thomas lifted the Europa League and European Super
          Cup, and also played in the 2016 Champions League final for his previous club. During five stellar seasons in
          the Spanish capital, he earned a reputation as one of the league's outstanding players.

          Named Ghana's Player of the Year in both 2018 and 2019, he is a mainstay of the national side, and has twice
          featured at the Africa Cup of Nations.

        <h3>Granit Xhaka</h3>
        <p>Combative midfielder Granit remains a cornerstone of the Arsenal midfield after another productive season in
          2020/21 during which he featured 45 times.

          The Switzerland international began his career at Basel, where he won two league titles and the Swiss Cup
          before joining Borussia Monchengladbach and making 140 appearances across four years for the Bundesliga side.

          Since joining the Gunners in 2016 he has lifted four more trophies, winning both the FA Cup and Community
          Shield twice. The midfielder, who is tough in the tackle and boasts a fearsome long-range shot, has
          represented his country at two World Cups and two European Championships, most recently at Euro 2020, where he
          was outstanding in the quarter-final win over France on penalties.

          Granit signed a contract extension at the start of the season.

        <p>
          It was another impressive season for Mo, during which the Egypt international passed the 100-appearance mark
          for the club.

          He impressed with his usual industry and intelligence in central midfield, while also chipping in with some
          spectacular goals. In December he blasted home from long-range in the Europa League group stage win at Dundalk
          - a strike later voted Arsenal.com Goal of the Season.

          Mo also netted against Olympiacos before registering his first Premier League goal, away to Newcastle United
          in May.

          Now into his seventh season with the Gunners, he joined from Basel, where he won four consecutive Swiss league
          titles. A full international since 2011, he scored in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations final, but Egypt lost 2-1
          to Cameroon.

        <h3>Fabio Vieira</h3>
        <p>Attacking midfielder Fabio joined during the summer just after helping Porto with the Portuguese
          championship.

          The left-footed creative midfielder racked up 14 assists and six goals from just 27 league appearances, as he
          continued his rapid development.

          A major part of the Portugal Under-21 squad, he helped them reach the final of the Under-21 European
          Championships in 2021, and was named Player of the Tournament.

          A Porto player from the age of eight, he won the UEFA Youth League in 2019, and progressed to make his
          first-team debut a year later.

          He soon became a regular in the Porto team, and scored in the Champions League group stage in 2020/21. He was
          named Primeria Liga Player of the Month for April 2022.

        <h3 class='oddh3'>Jorginho</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to making nearly 500 club appearances during his career, he has been a regular in the Italy
          national team squad for more than five years, making 46 appearances and winning Euro 2020 with his country.

          Brazilian-born, Jorginho started his career in the youth academy at Italian club Verona with his senior debut
          coming on loan at Serie C2 side Sambonifacese in 2010/11. After breaking through at Verona he spent four
          seasons in the first-team, helping them to promotion to Serie A and making 96 appearances before moving to
          Napoli.

          During his time in Naples, he won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana in 2014 and made 160 appearances
          during his four seasons with the club, and was rewarded with a first Italian cap, whom he qualifies for
          through his paternal great-grandfather, against Spain in March 2016.

          After following Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri to Chelsea in 2018, Jorginho was a fixture in their side and won
          the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup during his time at
          Stamford Bridge.

          Following a dream season in 2020/21 that culminated in European Championship glory for the Azzuri, he was
          named in the Champions League Squad of the Season, the European Championship Team of the Tournament and
          crowned UEFA Men's Player of the Year for 2020/21, as well as a third-place finish in the Ballon d'Or voting.

        <h3>Emile Smith Rowe</h3>
        <p>An immensely gifted, creative midfielder, Emile made massive strides last season and become an increasingly
          influential part of the team as the campaign wore on.

          A product of the Hale End academy, Emile joined Arsenal when he was 10 and played ahead of his age group as he
          progressed through the system. He made his first-team debut early in 2018/19, aged 18, and netted his first
          goal just two weeks later.

          After successful loan spells with Red Bull Leipzig in the Bundesliga in 2018/19 and Huddersfield Town in the
          Championship in 2019/20, he returned to the side last season, mainly operating in the No. 10 role.

          His first Premier League goal came at home to West Brom in May, and a few days later he struck the winner away
          to Chelsea. He also made his England Under-21 debut last season, having been part of the Under-17 World Cup
          winning side in 2017.

          Shortly before the start of this season Emile signed a new long-term contract, and was given the No. 10 shirt
          .

        <h3 class='oddh3'>Bukayo Saka</h3>
        <p>
          Arsenal's Player of the Season for 2020/21, Bukayo continued to make great strides forward last term,
          confirming his status as one of the hottest young prospects in European football.

          He notched seven goals in all competitions, and the same number of assists - no player had more for us last
          season. A hugely versatile player, Bukayo can play at full back but is usually deployed as a wide forward,
          using his pace and trickery to devastating effect.

          A product of our Hale End Academy, Bukayo has been with the club from the age of eight and made his first-team
          debut shortly after his 17th birthday, in 2018. He was called up to the England squad for Euro 2020, netting
          his first international goal in a friendly against Austria in June.

          He was one of the star performers for England at the tournament, winning man-of-the-match against the Czech
          Republic in the group stage, then becoming the youngest player ever to appear for England in a major final .
